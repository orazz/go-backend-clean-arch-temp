# Go Backend Clean Architecture

This project is a clone of the Golang Backend Clean Architecture by AMIT SHEKHAR, which you can find [here](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/go-backend-clean-architecture). I have made some modifications to this project, including changing the database from MongoDB to MySQL, using sqlmock for testing, and making minor adjustments. This project serves as a Go clean architecture template that you can use as a foundation for your own projects.

A Go (Golang) Backend Clean Architecture project with Gin, MySql, JWT Authentication Middleware, Test, and Docker.

**You can use this project as a template to build your Backend project in the Go language on top of this project.**
